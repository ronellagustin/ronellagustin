Hello everyone, my name is Ronell Agustin, and I'm a US Army Veteran who recently achieved my dream of moving to the Philippines to live permanently! ✈️

I have always been amazed by programming and now that I am settled in my new home I am jumping back into this wonderful world 🗺️.

I have a background in web development using React, mySQL, and C# but I am a bit rusty.  I am currently taking refresher courses and learning about REDUX, Typescript, MongoDB, Node.js, and Next.js.

My passion has always been videogame design 🎮 - and I have been learning Unity as a hobby in my freetime.

I currently have a 👶 baby on the way and I figured that now would be a great time to sharpen my skills and pursue my dream career.

Once I have completed my refresher courses I plan to apply for jobs in web development as a full-stack developer.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my repository 😁.
